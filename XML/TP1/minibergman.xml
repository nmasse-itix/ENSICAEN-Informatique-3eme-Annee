      <biographie>
         <p>Ingrid Bergman was born in Stockholm, Sweden on August 29, 1915. The actress who would be one of the top draws of Hollywood in the 1940's had decided to become an actress after finishing her formal schooling. She had had a taste of acting when she was 17 when she played an uncredited role of a girl standing in line in the Swedish film 
         <i>Landskamp</i> (1932) in 1932. Not much of a beginning for a girl who would be known as Her parents had died when she was just a girl and the uncle she lived with didn't want to stand in the way of Ingrid's dream.</p>
